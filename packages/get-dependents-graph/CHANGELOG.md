# @changesets/get-dependents-graph

## 1.0.0
### Major Changes



- [`cc8c921`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/cc8c92143d4c4b7cca8b9917dfc830a40b5cda20) [#290](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/290) Thanks [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton)! - Initial release of `@changesets/get-dependents-graph`. If you're migrating from `get-dependents-graph`, you will need to pass the `Packages` object(which is returned from `@manypkg/get-packages`) to `getDependentsGraph` and also import `getDependentsGraph` as a named export instead of a default export.
